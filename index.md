Hello and welcome to this blog.  

I am a software developer and technical architect as well as an Aikidoka.  
You'll find a few ideas here that have interested and excited me throughout my career.  

## What's in the Code ...

Or sometimes what's in the process.  
Some sparks with references to expand on my ideas.
